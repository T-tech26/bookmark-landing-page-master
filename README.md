## My process

### Built with

- useContext API
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS library

### What I learned

I learned how to make use of some of the react hooks, which are most commonly used though, which is useState, useEffect, and useContext, and I now have the complete understanding of how to use these three commonly used react hooks. And it was really fun building the project.

### Continued development

- React Hooks
- Redux Toolkit
- Tailwindcss Animations
- ES6 and above features
- Axios

### Useful resources

- [ChatGpt](https://www.chat.openai.com) - ChatGpt is a great tool to make use of, it's been useful to me because I use it as a refresher for some code snippets that I have forgotten as well for some logic that I do not know how to start the code.
